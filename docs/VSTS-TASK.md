# VSTS Task *** This documentation is out of date. The current generator codebase & the published package on the npm registry provide a lot more functionality. Updates to this documentation are in progress.****
## TL;DR - Current
Once you have created your new VSTS Task project with the generator, and installed the dependencies, you can upload your new task to your VSTS account by running:

```sh
npm run tfx-login
npm run pack-up-vsts-task
```
The login script will prompt you to enter your VSTS Service Url - https://{accountName}.visualstudio.com/{collection} i.e. https://foo.visualstudio.com/defaultcollection and
then for a [Personal Access Token][vsts-pat-url] (PAT).

You can also publish your task as an extension directly to the [VSTS Marketplace][vsts-marketplace-url] by running:

```sh
npm run pack-pub-vsts-task-extension
```

You will also need to have a [VSTS Marketplace Publisher Account][vsts-publisher-extension-url] and a [PAT with access to the Marketplace][vsts-extension-pat-url] in order to be able to publish your extension. Additionally, your extension will be private by default and you will be able to share it with various VSTS accounts. If you want your extension to be public and discoverable on the Marketplace, then you will have to follow the steps to [Publicize][vsts-publicize-extension-url] your extension.

## **** Old Documentation Continues Below ******

The VSTS Task project type gives you everything you need to add your own custom Build and/or Release tasks for [Visual Studio Team Services][vsts-url] (VSTS is a an end to end ALM platform that can be used for *free*. You should definitely check it out!). Although VSTS Tasks can be written in either Node.js or PowerShell, this generator scaffolds a new project for working with Node.js. 
  
As with other project types, the generator will also give you all of the [boilerplate content][boilerplate-doc], which we highly recommend reviewing as it provides the details on generator content
that is standard across all project types like testing, linting, and more. You can also review the [high level usage overview][usage-overview-url] for more details about using the generator.

## Directory Structure & Content
The generator will create a new VSTS Task project that has the following content:  
  
*** Very outdated directory structure and content***
  
![VSTS Task Directory Structure][vsts-dir-structure-img]

### Standard Files
All of the standard files outlined in the [boilerplate doc][boilerplate-standard-section] are included, along with a few VSTS task/extension specific files:

- *extension-icon.png* - This is the image/icon that will represent your task in VSTS
- *OVERVIEW.md* - Contains the information/page that will be displayed for your extension in the VSTS Marketplace
- *task.json* - Defines your task
- *vss-extension.json* - Defines your extension configuration, which is required if you choose to package and publish your task(s) to the VSTS Marketplace for others to consume

### What Needs to be Updated

### Source Code
There are several sample/starter files that the generator creates for you. This sample content shows various patterns and ways of interacting with the VSTS system. The initial task 
created by the generator shows a simple mathematical addition of two numerical parameters, as well as displaying the count of Team Projects by interacting with the VSTS APIs. You may begin building off 
of these starter files or remove them entirely and start from scratch. Regardless, the source code for your task should go within the 'src' directory. The two sample/starter files the generator 
creates for you in the 'src' directory are:

- *main.ts*
- *helper.ts*

The 'main.ts' file is the main executable that is called by the VSTS task runner engine. This is where build information, variables, etc. can be obtained by interacting with the VSTS task system.
Think of this main file as the entry point to begin the process of executing your task. However, the bulk of the work for your task should be performed by other classes/files. This is demonstrated by 
the 'main.ts' file interacting with a Helper class defined in the 'helper.ts' file. 
  
The 'main.ts' shows how you can get inputs (via build variables and user defined parameter values), use those inputs to perform various operations, and display info/output. The 'helper.ts' file 
defines the Helper class which performs a couple of basic operations, while using ES6 promises: basic addition of two numbers and getting the number of Team Projects in the account by interacting 
with the VSTS APIs.  
  
![VSTS Task Main.ts][main.ts-img]  
  
![VSTS Task Helper.ts][helper.ts-img]  

### Transpiling
The TypeScript source code needs to be transpiled to JavaScript prior to publishing. This can be done via an npm command (or gulp if you really want) as outlined in the 
[boilerplate documentation][boilerplate-building=section]. Many of the other tasks/scripts will automatically execute this step for you prior to performing their function, so you won't
usually need to run this yourself. For example, when you run the tests (see next section below) transpilation will happen automatically as a prerequisite.

```sh
npm run transpile
```  

### Unit Tests
In today's world, automated tests are a necessity. The generator creates corresponding suites of tests for the aforementioned example classes/files, along with all the basic plumbing. 
This plumbing allows you to run the tests from an npm script as well as directly through a gulp task. You can find more details about the tests, code coverage, and more in 
[the common testing documentation][boilerplate-testing-section]. Note that running the tests will automatically transpile your code for you, so there is no need to run any tasks manually
in advance.  
  
You can kick off your unit tests via:
```sh
npm test
```  

Or even better, run your tests and ensure they meet a minimum level of code coverage. The generator creates your new VSTS task project on the right footing with 100% code coverage, and you
should really strive to keep that going!  
  
```sh
npm run enforce-code-coverage
```

### Debugging/Validating
Due to the nature of the VSTS tasks, there isn't really a "localhost" equivalent to validate the functionality of your task. The easiest way (that we know of) is to simply publish your task
to a VSTS account where you have the necessary permissions. This is accomplished via the CLI Utility (tfx)
